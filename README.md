# A-Life Scratchpad

This is a space for trying out new ideas in preparation for A-Life Challenge 2.0 Capstone project.

## Team Standards

| Category | Standard |
| - | :- |
| Project Goals | Create a comprehensive, highly configurable, simulation of simple life and evolution. |
| Communication (asynchronous and synchronous). List desired frequency. | Using MS Teams with asynchronous and synchronous mix (1 â€“ 2 meetings a week with regular updates over chat)  |
| Meeting logistics and preparation (roles? responsibilities?) | Ad-Hoc and Agile. Special meetings, like a map day, should have more structure with a driver. |
| Types of meetings (sprint, standup, design, code, review, etc) | 1 Map-day (project plan), regular standup, weekly meeting. |
| Project management tool(s) (spreadsheet, Trello, Monday, Basecamp, Asana, Jira, etc) | Trello or GitHub Boards (very little overhead) |
| Code repo (github vs gitlab vs bitbucket?) | GitHub |
| Work Quality | Test Driven Development (when it makes sense). Code reviews as part of the weekly meeting. Adhere to applicable code standards. (e.g. PEP 8, .NET Conventions, etc. ) |
| Conflict management (what will you do if there is disagreement on how to proceed?) | Collaborate, Democratize (if necessary), then commit to a decision |
